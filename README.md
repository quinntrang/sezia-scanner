### Skincare Ingredient Scanner

- We are building a skincare ingredient scanner mobile app. It will scan ingredient lists from a skin care product and check if the product is fungal acne-safe. An existing website for this is https://www.sezia.co/, but there's no scanning capability to it. We hope that this functionality facilitates safety-checking for those affected by fungal acne!
